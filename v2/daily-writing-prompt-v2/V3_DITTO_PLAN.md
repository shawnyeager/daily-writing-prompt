- **Response Feed**: Browse and discover responses from other writers
- **Prompt Communities**: Join groups focused on specific prompt categories
- **Response Reactions**: Like, comment, and react to other users' responses

### 2. Social Discovery

### Data Migration Strategy
- V2.0 local responses can be optionally published to Nostr
- Maintain backward compatibility with local-only storage
- Gradual onboarding to community features

### Privacy Considerations
- **Default Private**: All responses remain private by default
- **Granular Sharing**: Per-response privacy controls
- **Pseudonymous Options**: Allow anonymous participation
- **Data Ownership**: Users maintain full control over their data

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Daily active users and response sharing rates
- **Community Health**: Response quality and positive interactions
- **Retention**: User return rates and writing streak maintenance
- **Growth**: New user acquisition through community discovery

## Migration Path from V2.0
1. **Seamless Upgrade**: V3.0 includes all V2.0 functionality
2. **Optional Social**: Users can choose to enable community features
3. **Data Continuity**: Local writing streaks and responses are preserved
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Social features are additive, not replacement

This plan positions V3.0 as a natural evolution that transforms individual writing practice into a thriving community experience while preserving the core daily prompt functionality that makes the app valuable.
